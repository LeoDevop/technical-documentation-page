                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. 
                  </p>

     <div class="">

          <article>
            <p>
              An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets <code>&lt; &gt;</code>. There are a few empty or void tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets the element:
            </p>
            <p> <img src="/images/syntax.png" alt="Syntax of an HTML element"></p>
            <p>
              The anatomy of our element is:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><stong><code>The opening tag</code></stong>: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><stong><code>The content</code></stong>: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><stong><code>The closing tag</code></stong>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
          </article>
      </section> 
     </div>
    
    <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
      <header>Attributes</header>
      <article>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
        <p><img src="/images/attributes.png" alt="Element with a class attribute"></p>
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>      
    <section class="main-section" id="Anchor_Elements">
      <header>Anchor Elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>Another example of an element is <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. This stands for anchor. An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <stong><code>href</code></stong> "This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example: href="https://www.mozilla.org/".</li>
          <li><stong><code>title</code></stong>: The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, title="The Mozilla homepage". This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.</li>
          <li><stong><code>target</code></stong> The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example, target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.</li>
        </ul>

      <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
       <article>
         <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
         <p><img src="/images/anatomy.PNG" alt="Anatomy of an HTML document"></p>
         <p>Here we have:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>
           <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:
           <p>
           <img src="/images/doctype.PNG" alt="">
           </p>
            <p>
              More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right.<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!
            </p>  
         </li>
         <li>
           <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The html element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
         <li>
           <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article of the series.</li>
         <li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
         <li><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
         <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
        </ol>
